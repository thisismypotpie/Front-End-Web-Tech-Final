- Add loading functionality for pre-game squad building.
- Come up with some sketches for the in-game interface.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.
-Add the ability to see the details of each ship when you are in pilot skill selection mode. I was thinking of adding a button which would bring up a clone of team view except that it only shows the ships are on in the line up for being selected.
- Add a current maneuver variable to each ship.
