-I need to find a way to deal with upgrades that add maneuvers to a ship.

- There was a crash when Alex's team was eliminated.

-Have dual sided upgrades change orietation on each upgrade screen and view as the flip button is pressed.

Galactic Conquest To Do's:
1. When purchasing ships, take away full resource screen if player is only playing with currency.
4. When implementing a transfer, this can only be done if the ship is x spaces away depending on the size of the ship.
9. Make it so repairs and creating new ships can only happen when a group is on a planet.
10. Add to path dots whcih section they are from in order to take unused sectors away from the map if not used.
11. Add a multitude of scenerios for different types of battles to take place.
12. Update the placement and building phase so that instead of getting a confirm for any place you press, you only get a message on viable spaces.
13. After a combat engagement, go to building phase instead of staying in movement phase.

HOW REPAIRS SHOULD WORK:
- Use electronics to restore shields.
- use durasteel to restore hull.
- use tibanna to restore attack.
- use parts to restore agility.
- use corresponding parts to get rid of critical hits and conditions.


Bugs:
- If you start a new galactic conquest game and then press the previous page icon, then the game freezes.
- When crippling a large ship, if you press the flip button, the side that is still alive still have it's hull value with lower opacity.
- If you retreat on the movement phase, you get the error specified in surrender-team.js line 173: ERROR: Unable to get next ship, all ships have been searched and there is no possible next ship.(Tested, indeterminate bug).
-When a roster number is already taken, the old one is not deleted with a focus on the number entry element.
-When a large ship is crippled, show it in team view instead of the non-crippled card.

Scenerios:
1. Dogfight
2. Snatch and Grab(CTF)
3. Torch and Burn: Destroy cargo before it escapes.
4. Cripple the Fleet: Destroy enemy large ship.
5. Assault (Destroy enemy asset on the other side of the map.)
6. Outlast: Survive x turns.
7. Hold the line: Get to the other side to escape.
8. 
9.
10.
