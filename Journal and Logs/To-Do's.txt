- Add loading functionality for pre-game squad building.

Simon TODO
- Media queries.
- Implement multiplayer system.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.

-Change the difference between YT-1300 and Yt-1300 special.

- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

- Add the following feature:
a) pressing the back button in game no longer removes all of the session storage except for the ship.
b) Ending the game removes all game data.
c) add a "continue game" button that will continue the game where it left off if you are in game and press the back button.
d) The feature itself is for adding ships to a game in progress.

- Make it so when you save on the team screen, if you have already started a game, save on the correct type of game.

- I need to incorperate the loading screen into the main title so that the user knows when the game is loading.
