- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

-Make a surrender button. If a team decides to surrender the game will end.

-Add color sync to each stat in game so that the numbers to not get confused.

-Add left and right arrow key bindings when looking through team for target locks and searching.

-Add ordnance tokens to upgrades.

-In the movement and attack phase, if you look up another ship, have a "reveal" button that will reveal that ship's chosen maneuver.

Add tools button with the following tools:
1. Add new ship mid-game
2. Dice for other phases of the game besides the attack phase
3. Notepad/reminders for player

-Ships with dual sided upgrades, their orientation is not saved into the game.

-When a ship is crippled, make it show up when you hit zero hull instead of havnig to press the flip button twice.

-Convert as many alert messages as you can into the notification pop-up.

- Add key bindings for the token and stat change pop-ups. These will be a bit harder as they will not fit comfortably into the button-bindings.js page.
