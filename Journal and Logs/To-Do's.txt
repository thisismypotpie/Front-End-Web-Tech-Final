Simon TODO
- Media queries.
- Implement multiplayer system.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.

-Change the difference between YT-1300 and Yt-1300 special.

- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

-Make a surrender button. If a team decides to surrender the game will end.
