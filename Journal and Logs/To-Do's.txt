Simon TODO

- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.
-Add the ability to see the details of each ship when you are in pilot skill selection mode. I was thinking of adding a button which would bring up a clone of team view except that it only shows the ships are on in the line up for being selected.

- I will need to add big ship functionality as far as flip buttons go for the following:
1. The main flip button and energy stat for large ships in the main screen.
2. The flip button and energy stat in the view target lock pop up.

- There is an error if you have a team of one and then remove it using the remove ship button.

- I need to test to see if big ship specific critical hit cards work.

-Make sure to move a ship to the correct area when someone's pilot skill is changed.

-Add functionality to the back button in the main maneuver selection screen.

-In team view, I would like to add some functionality where you can change your stats by click, like in the maneuver selection screen.

-When altering the pilot skill, make sure the player cannot go above 12.

-Center the buttons around the roster number assignment aspect of the upgrade screen.
