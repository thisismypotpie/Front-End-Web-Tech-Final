Simon TODO
- Media queries.
- Implement multiplayer system.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.

-Change the difference between YT-1300 and Yt-1300 special.

- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

- Begin first thoughts on galactic conquest feature of the app (stretch goal supreme).

-Add flip button to all upgrade screens(for some reason I did not add them there).

-In the order selection screen, show roster number on card. I could not tell which was which when there were five of the same TIE fighter to sort.

-make it so focus and evade tokens go away at end of round.
-When adding TIE fighters, wampa appeared again even though he was picked and unique.
-The flip button is visible for all ships when removing a target lock.
- remove tokens at end of round.
-If someone has critical hit cards, have that show up first rather than upgrades.
- Add focus to number input when you change teams with target lock and search.
-Remove target lock of someone if they die to prevent errors.
-when a ship dies, usually there is a search happening and the next pilot gets put into a search, make sure search  is off when after a ship dies.
