- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

-Make a surrender button. If a team decides to surrender the game will end.

-Add ordnance tokens to upgrades.

Add tools button with the following tools:
1. Add new ship mid-game
2. Dice for other phases of the game besides the attack phase
3. Notepad/reminders for player

-Ships with dual sided upgrades, their orientation is not saved into the game.

-When a ship is crippled, make it show up when you hit zero hull instead of havnig to press the flip button twice.

-Convert as many alert messages as you can into the notification pop-up.

- Add key bindings for the token and stat change pop-ups. These will be a bit harder as they will not fit comfortably into the button-bindings.js page.

-I need to find a way to deal with upgrades that add maneuvers to a ship.

- There was a crash when Alex's team was eliminated.

- There is an error with the key binding in the maneuver selection screen revolving around pressing the enter button to go to the next ship. It works fine in maneuver selection but gets stuck on the same ship when doing movement or attack phase.
