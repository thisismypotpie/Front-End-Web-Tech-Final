-I need to find a way to deal with upgrades that add maneuvers to a ship.

- There was a crash when Alex's team was eliminated.

-Have dual sided upgrades change orietation on each upgrade screen and view as the flip button is pressed.

Galactic Conquest To Do's:
1. When purchasing ships, take away full resource screen if player is only playing with currency.
4. When implementing a transfer, this can only be done if the ship is x spaces away depending on the size of the ship.
7. When a ship moves, calculate for pirate interaction.
8. Make sure when the game is over to remove the initative token from each team so that there are not mulitple team with that token.
9. Make it so repairs can only happen when a group is on a planet.
10. Add to path dots whcih section they are from in order to take unused sectors away from the map if not used.

HOW REPAIRS SHOULD WORK:
- Use electronics to restore shields.
- use durasteel to restore hull.
- use tibanna to restore attack.
- use parts to restore agility.
- use corresponding parts to get rid of critical hits and conditions.


Bugs:
- If you start a new galactic conquest game and then press the previous page icon, then the game freezes.
- When crippling a large ship, if you press the flip button, the side that is still alive still have it's hull value with lower opacity.
- If you retreat on the movement phase, you get the error specified in surrender-team.js line 173: ERROR: Unable to get next ship, all ships have been searched and there is no possible next ship.
-When a roster number is already taken, the old one is not deleted with a focus on the number entry element.
