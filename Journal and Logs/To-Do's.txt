- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.


Add tools button with the following tools:
1. Add new ship mid-game
2. Notepad/reminders for players
3. Going back to the main menu from the options tab.

-When a ship is crippled, make it show up when you hit zero hull instead of havnig to press the flip button twice.

- Add key bindings for the token and stat change pop-ups. These will be a bit harder as they will not fit comfortably into the button-bindings.js page.

-I need to find a way to deal with upgrades that add maneuvers to a ship.

- There was a crash when Alex's team was eliminated.

-Have dual sided upgrades change orietation on each upgrade screen and view as the flip button is pressed.
