Simon TODO
- Media queries.
- Implement multiplayer system.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.

-Change the difference between YT-1300 and Yt-1300 special.

- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

- Begin first thoughts on galactic conquest feature of the app (stretch goal supreme).

-There is an error if you try to save while searching for a ship, the save game saves the ship you are searching as their turn instead of the ship who's turn it actually is.

- In the team screen, if there is a team name that takes up more than one line, the cost and number for ship columns are no longer aligned.
