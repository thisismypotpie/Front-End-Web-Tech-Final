Simon TODO
- Media queries.
- Implement multiplayer system.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.

-Change the difference between YT-1300 and Yt-1300 special.

- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

- Begin first thoughts on galactic conquest feature of the app (stretch goal supreme).

-Add flip button to all upgrade screens(for some reason I did not add them there).

-In the order selection screen, show roster number on card. I could not tell which was which when there were five of the same TIE fighter to sort.

-The flip button is visible for all ships when removing a target lock.

- Add focus to number input when you change teams with target lock and search.

-Remove target lock of someone if they die to prevent errors.

-Make a surrender button. If a team decides to surrender the game will end.

-Upgrades are messed up when assigning them during the game.
