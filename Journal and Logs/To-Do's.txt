Simon TODO
- Media queries.
- Implement multiplayer system.
- Come up with the database schema for loading and saving games.

-Change the difference between YT-1300 and Yt-1300 special.

- I need clearer rules when it comes to when one can change their pilot skill.

- Potentially add a reminder function that will keep reminders for the end of the round.

-Make a surrender button. If a team decides to surrender the game will end.

-When you use a unique pilot, make sure to remove their unique upgrade from selection choices.

-Add color sync to each stat in game so that the numbers to not get confused.

-Add left and right arrow key bindings when looking through team for target locks and searching.

-Add enter key binding when selecting search or target lock.

-Add ordnance tokens to upgrades.

-In the movement and attack phase, if you look up another ship, have a "reveal" button that will reveal that ship's chosen maneuver.

Add tools button with the following tools:
1. Add new ship mid-game
2. Dice for other phases of the game besides the attack phase
3. Notepad/reminders for player

-Ships with dual sided upgrades, their orientation is not saved into the game.

-When a ship is crippled, make it show up when you hit zero hull instead of havnig to press the flip button twice.

-Make is so when the pilot screen show all pilots, have an algorithm that will sort pilots by pilot skill so that it does not rely on order to work. 

-Upgrade updates in the db have removed characteristics and therefore have borken dual sided upgrades across the app, I need to fix this.
