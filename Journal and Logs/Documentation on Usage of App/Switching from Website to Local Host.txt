This document is intended for use if the user wants to either switch from local host to the heroku deploy or vise versa:

1. dbInteraction.js(back end)
-There is a line that looks like this: var port = process.env.PORT||3000;
- Comment out the "process.env.PORT" if you want to keep things local (port 3000 in this case) or keep the whole line if you want heroku deploy to respond.

2. Title-Screen.js(front end)
- Get data:
- Look for this line: var url = "https://star-wars-x-wing-back-end.herokuapp.com/get_data";//"http://localhost:3000/get_data";
-local host is for local and the herokuapp url is for heroku.

-Get game names: 
-    var url = "https://star-wars-x-wing-back-end.herokuapp.com/get_game_names";//"http://localhost:3000/get_game_names"

-Loading game:
           var url ="https://star-wars-x-wing-back-end.herokuapp.com/load_game"//"http://localhost:3000/load_game";

3. save-input-detector.js(front-end)
-Save game:
"https://star-wars-x-wing-back-end.herokuapp.com/save_game";//"http://localhost:3000/save_game"
-Get game names:
       var url = "https://star-wars-x-wing-back-end.herokuapp.com/get_game_names";//"http://localhost:3000/get_game_names";
-overwriting games:
                        var url = "https://star-wars-x-wing-back-end.herokuapp.com/overwrite_game";//"http://localhost:3000/overwrite_game";
