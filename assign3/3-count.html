        It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
        wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
        was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
        season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
        despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were
        all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in
        short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its
        noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
        evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king
        with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of
        England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair
        face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than
        crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
        things in general were settled for ever. It was the year of Our Lord one
        thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were
        conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott
        had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a
        prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance
        by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of
        London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a
        round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of
        this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality)
        rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had
        lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British
        subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more
        important to the human race than any communications yet received through
        any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
